# Evocation Station


## Project concept: 

Evocation Station is a site for users who want to create evocative, meaningful collections of sounds, images, and writings to share.

## User Stories

As a user, I can login to the site, and create an account if I haven't done so yet. Once logged in, I can learn what an evocation is by browsing through the current evocations, as well as the crafting materials required to make them. Sounds, images, and writings are available from a menu bar, and can each be selected to add to the evocation template. Materials can be detached from the template if changes are needed. Once a user has created a satisfactory template, they can submit it, and the browser will be redirected to the posted evocations, showing the user their addition. Custom materials may also be uploaded, using the provided rich text editor, and the image and sound file uploads form. Any text formatting submitted through the editor will be retained, such as indentations and spacing, text alignment, bold and italic text, and text color. Users can delete their evocations as well.
